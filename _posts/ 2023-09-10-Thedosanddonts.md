# The do's and dont's of a homemade cloud gaming server - Backend\Server PC

In this log I am going to be talking about the mistakes I have done, the things that I learned and the tools I use to improve my cloud gaming experience.

Let's start with the more necessary, and second most important part of this setup:

## 1 - The Hardware
Not least important than the software that will allow us to use the computer as a cloud gaming server, the server computer. Here we have to think about the kind of games (and how) we want to play.

With modern day Playstation games coming to PC this does water down a bit of the options, though not the experiences.

If your main system is a playstation connected to your tv, that too can be your server computer, just as your Xbox can be. if that's the case you can skip this chapter.

Okay... still here? Great I will then assume you want to use your PC as your server computer, right? if you want to play Switch via the cloud you are doing it wrong...

Okay, PC, which kind of PC? Tower as mentioned in a previous log, Upgrade-ability is the name of the game here, so if possible I would suggest a big case for more room for components and the manoeuvrability inside the case for upgrades. 

### So you are committed into getting a PC for this use case?

It's best to start small... If you are into the PC enthusiasts community you will know it's cheaper to build your own tower PC, but here is a harsh truth of many harsh truths:

#### Do you have the time?

[Picking parts](https://pcpartpicker.com/), making sure they are compatible, ordering them, spending a day assembling it, troubleshooting, installing windows...

Are you sure you wanna do that? To build one might be prideful, an achievement on itself, but is the trouble worth it? If yes go for it but if not, it's okay.

Prebuilt PC's are a good basis, some even come with windows installed making them plug and play, as in plug a keyboard in and game, not plug in and everything is ready for cloud gaming on it.

As the time of writing [this](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/bzvRJy) is my close to my current specs. 

My failings in it currently is the power supply, I need to upgrade it to a higher wattage since my 3060 RTX card can straight up crash my setup if I turn RTX on in some games, and being able to overclock to the Bios presets my CPU without blue-screening would also be good for the longevity of the build. Remember, we want a powerful Server PC that outmatches local power.

### "Don't you have phones?"

Infamous line, am I right? But...well it's true, at least in our case, when I started a Bluetooth controller strapped to my phone was the best possible option, why?

#### The (lack of) existence of a good android handheld

Back when i started the newest version of android was android 4, do to how android consoles get made, if any existed at that time they would be extremely under power and outdated fast, not only in terms of hardware but also software. That seems perfect for a cloud front end right? Wrong what we want is something that can run stuff locally and pair with the newest acessories. Something Sony didn't understand with their [try](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F416EkmWwAAzCrr?format=jpg&name=4096x4096).

Basically imagine you are seeing a guide for the game you are streaming, do you want to pull another phone or device to watch/read the guide on? 

How about music? You want to hear the ODST at your own pace and do some sight seing? Heck, how about even just chilling out hearing lofi or musics from our childhood while enjoying and openworld game or a chill RPG?

Those things do require something the Playstation Portal lacks, proper bluetooth support and the ability of running either chrome, youtube or spotify locally, not even mentioning social apps like discord or twitter.

#### Having proper bluetooth doesn't mean everything works

I found out recently, when i got my Odin lite, that android only got proper PS5 controller support in android 13 and my Odin lite is android 11.

At first I was a bit bummed out since i do have a scuff PS5 controller that I love and can't use on the Odin. Sure I own a Steam Deck that does laps around the Odin, but...

#### Size Matters

The Steam Deck could be the most powerful computer in the world with the so many games that would make NASA cry, but size matters. An handheld is only as powerful as it's use case, the Odin Lite is definitely outdated, I knew what i was going to get myself in before i purchased it, as I already did have my Steam Deck.

But unlike the Steam Deck, the Odin is pocket-able, I can go on a long 3 hour three hour journey and pull out my Odin for some cloud gaming or even local retro gaming and not have the trouble of getting it out of my bag, but for local AAA or AA or even indie gaming the Steam Deck wins hands down.

## 2- GET TO THE POINT!!!   

Okay, Okay...

PS5/PS4: [This](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=psplay.grill.com&hl=pt_PT&gl=US) **payed** app is the best way to stream your PlayStation to your Android.

Xbox: [You know this one.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass&hl=en_US)

Nintendo: [It's dangerous to go alone take this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

PC: ... PC: ....

PC: It's complicated, like Rick-Rolling Nintendo fans, it needs to be carefully planned:

Simple with paid options? [Parsec](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.parsec.client&hl=pt_PT&gl=US).

Open Source but more configurable? [Moonlight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limelight&hl=pt_PT&gl=US)/[Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) combo.

Don't care and use steam of everything? [SteamLink](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink&hl=en_US).
