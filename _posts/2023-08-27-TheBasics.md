### Why Cloud? Why not local computing power?
There are many ways of interacting with computing power, an android phone, a laptop, heck even handheld PCs have been a thing for a while. 

Why use cloud power? 

First the basics, what is cloud computing?

According to [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-computing), "cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change".

But to put it simply, generally it's a computer( usually a server) from another person ( a Company) that you can pay to use, usually needed to shift the costs of running a local server for either a website or a more specialized service.

### Okay, but why the cloud?
When I began this journey the answer was simple: _Portability!_

Back then the NVIDIA shield was a popular device, meant to show the power of NVIDIA's Graphic cards, while bringing full PC gaming to the couch.

Though the technology was there, the horse power wasn't. At the time the most powerful graphics card was the 1080TI on the consumers side. Even then it proved hard to render a game and stream it on the same network on a laptop, basically requiring a Desktop PC.

So the logical step is either buy an expensive (500 to 900 euro) PC considering to the most casual of gamers building a Desktop PC is too much, not only due to inexperience of getting the parts and checking compatibility but also the plug and play aspect of it. Or...

Why not rent someone elses PC for a few hours of gaming? If someone already did the effort of building a powerful Desktop and is renting it for a fee, why pay more than 20 euros to play now on a subscription service? In the short term it's way better than paying upfront for a physical PC that uses power and space.

This is what spawned services like Geforce Now, Stadia[Rest in peace], Amazon Luna, Xcloud and playstation's cloud streaming. Allowing users to use weak hardware as a front-end device for a more powerful server computer.

### Why did I pick local computing power?   

Technology wasn't there, but nothing beat owning the actual hardware which ran my software (Games). Initially a weak laptop was my local computing power, same network 'in house streaming' was great and the games I wanted to play ran just fine. Using a android phone strapped to a controller.

But times change, what once was a good enough PC, became outdated...

#### Do I buy another laptop and let it be outdated with the passage of time?

Nope, I decide to buy a pre-made desktop PC with a big case, why?   _Upgradability!_

Need more RAM, get more RAM!
Need Better GPU, get a Newer GPU!

Same for storage and even cooling.

### Where are we now?

Recently I got an Odin lite as a front-end to my 'cloud gaming' needs
