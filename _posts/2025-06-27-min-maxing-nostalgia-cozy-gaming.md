# Min-Maxing, Nostalgia & Cozy Gaming
*A reflection on how we game—and why we might want to slow down.*

## Disclaimer

Let me start with a small disclaimer: this isn’t some grand manifesto. It’s not here to moralize or to make a statement about the world beyond our screens. It's just a reflection—one gamer to another—about the strange, fascinating ways we interact with games. This is about habits, nostalgia, preferences, and that low hum of longing that sits beneath the things we do for fun.

Yes, there are deeper parallels to be drawn—to how we live, to how we compete, to how we cope. But this isn’t the place for that. This is about gaming.

## What is Min-Maxing?

I first heard the term “min-maxing” in a Harvard course on artificial intelligence. Not in a game dev class, not on Twitch, not even on Reddit—but in the study of algorithms and logic. It came down to a scenario with two chess players:

One player, the **Maximizer**, wants to win at any cost. Every move is calculated, every tactic weaponized, even if it leads to a tedious, joyless endgame. Victory is everything.

The other player, the **Minimizer**, doesn’t care about the win. They just want the game to *end*—quickly, cleanly, decisively. Whether they lose in two moves or ten, efficiency is their north star.

One plays for the trophy. The other plays to *not be playing* anymore.

Their reward structures are entirely different.  
One is chasing dominance.  
The other is chasing closure.

And suddenly, the metaphor explodes.  
You realize this isn’t just about chess.  
It’s about people. About how we approach everything—especially games.

## Min-Maxing Across the Gaming Landscape

As I wandered through the fragmented world of gaming—retro, cozy, modern (for lack of a better word)—I started seeing these patterns everywhere.

In forums.  
In subreddits.  
In comment sections beneath YouTube breakdowns of 20-year-old titles.  

People are *min-maxing* their fun. And sometimes, that means squeezing the joy out in the process.

## Retrogaming’s Quiet Paradox

Let’s start with retrogaming. It should be simple, right? Pure nostalgia. Old sounds, chunky pixels, remembered joys.

But the reality is we’ve made even that into something more complicated.

How many retro doodads do you own?  
How many cartridges, ROMs, modded consoles, handhelds with emulators running three OSes stacked like a digital cake?

Now ask yourself: are you playing these games to enjoy them… or to *consume* them?

There’s a subtle pressure in the retro scene. A quiet scoreboard that nobody talks about, but everyone feels. How many titles have you finished? How “authentic” is your setup? CRT or bust?

And so two camps begin to form:  

- The **DieHards**: No cheats. No save states. Rewind? That’s for VHS tapes, not gameplay. If you didn’t beat the game raw, did you even beat it at all?  
- The **Dweebs** (I say it lovingly): The ones who are here for *fun*. They’re not ashamed to throw on an infinite lives code or rewind to avoid redoing an entire level because of a cheap hitbox.

There’s no judgment here. Just the observation that even nostalgia gets filtered through our obsession with “doing it right.”

## The Performance Pressure of Modern Gaming

Shift to modern gaming and things only intensify. It’s not just about winning anymore—it’s about winning *well*. It’s about *meta*. Tier lists. Patch notes. Loadouts optimized within a decimal point of efficiency.

You’re not just playing Destiny 2, you’re calculating the light level delta of your build against the new seasonal modifier.  
You’re not just enjoying Marvel Rivals, you’re watching five-hour breakdowns of which character is viable in 3v3 matchups at mid-to-high skill caps.

And when things don’t go right, we default to blaming the team.  
Why do my teammates suck?  
Why does the other team *always* get lucky?  
Why does the matchmaking system hate me?

It stops being play and starts becoming something else.  
A grind. A job. A loop of input and output—fun reduced to metrics.

## Nostalgia is a Beautiful Liar

Now, let’s be honest. We romanticize the past. And rightly so. There’s a real, visceral joy in remembering the first time you found a shortcut in a racing game. The way your heart beat when you beat a level you thought was impossible. The hours you lost in summer vacation wrapped around a Game Boy screen.

We love those memories. They’re golden.  
But they’re also *liars*.

They don’t tell us about the hours we spent stuck. The coins wasted on arcade cabinets. The sleep lost trying to figure out what the hell that one boss's pattern was.

Nostalgia is a friend to fun.  
But responsibility is its natural predator.  
Work, errands, bills, your cat's litterbox. Your new handheld stuck in customs. You want to play, but the weight of being an adult presses harder than any game’s difficulty curve.

And so, the magic flickers.

## Modern Min-Maxing, and the Loss of the In-Between

Let’s say you want to beat a game—maybe one of the Marathon titles from Portmaster.games. You’re not just playing. You’re *preparing*. You’re watching guides. Finding spreadsheets with weapon data. Tracking DPS over time. Digging up glitches that let you break the level geometry and skip half the game.

You’re not playing. You’re analyzing.  
You’re not discovering. You’re replicating.  
You’re not experiencing. You’re completing.

And yes, it feels good. Beating a system is addictive. But there’s a cost: you bypass the surprise. You miss the stumble, the “aha!”, the sudden thrill of finding your own way through.

**You become someone who finishes games… without ever really beating them.**  
And somewhere in that trade, the joy that brought you here in the first place starts to slip through the cracks.

## Cozy Gaming: Where Being Present is the Win

So why did I write all this?

To remind myself—and maybe you—that there’s another path. A softer one. A smaller one. One where we don't play to win or finish or optimize.

**Cozy gaming** is where the goal *isn’t* the goal. It’s where you light a candle, boot up your handheld, and just… exist. Inspired by aesthetics like TechDweeb’s pastel RGB desk setups and low-fi music floating through quiet headphones, it’s a rebellion against the grind. A gentle refusal.

You drop into Quickplay.  
You evolve your Pokémon for no real reason.  
You pick a world you’ll never finish—your *Minecraft forever world*.  
You sit in your RGB cocoon and let the clock stop ticking for a while.

The bills are still there. The inbox still full. But for a fleeting moment, so are *you*.

And that has to count for something.

## Final Thought: You Don’t Have to Earn Your Fun

Sometimes, the best game isn’t the one with the most frames, the best patch support, or the highest rating.  
It’s the one you played at the right time, in the right state of mind, where a fleeting moment became a permanent memory.

You don’t have to earn your fun.  
You don’t need to be efficient to be joyful.  
You don’t need to finish something to be changed by it.

**Give yourself the praise of gaming**, without the weight of doing it “right.”
